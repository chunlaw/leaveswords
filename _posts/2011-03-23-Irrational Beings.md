How to proof that human is a irrational rather than rational beings??  
  
When I watched 'House' last night, it used a story to proof that. Dr. House told Dr. Chris Taub that his wife had saved amount of money serectly, and House thought that she would betray Chris. House predicted Chris would not only forgive his wife, but also confessed his love affair. Although it was not the best choice, Chris would do it. Obviously, Chris was irrational.  
  
The privat detective whom was appointed by House said his boss was not rational too. Chris had shifted his job with Dr. House in order to his affair. If he confessed to his wife, he would leave Dr. House. Dr. house was therefore also irrational.  
  
While we study Economics, we always assume that people are rational beings and will always choose the best choice. Isn't it grotesque?  
  
In 'Notes from underground' by Fyodor Dostoyevsky, he also attempted to illustrate human would choose in accordance with free will. He set an extreme case. As our technology progressed to an ultimate status which can tell us the most rational choice, we should do like what the technology told us to do. Then people will surely not follow the technology!  
  
It is true because we have free will.  
  
Frankly, I had a similar experience. A long long time ago, I realized someone have been blocking me in WLM for no reason, but she hid it for me. It should be all right if I don't ask for her explanation. At least I can feel nothing while we saw each other. However, I did, for no reason, ask her. This action has been turning our friendship got worse so far.  
  
Apparently, I am irrational as same as everybody in the world.  
  
In brief, that's why I never trust the 'science' about human, especially Economics.
